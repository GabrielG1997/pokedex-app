# PokedexApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.0.

It was developed during the bootcamp "CAIXA - IA Generativa com Microsoft Copilot" provided by [DIO](https://web.dio.me/) in a partnership with [Caixa](https://www.caixa.gov.br/). 

## One of the challenges was to create a E-Book using Generative AI to boost the quality and the speed of the project and the E-BOOK creation.

During this project, I've used: 
### [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app/) 
To create a beautiful pptx template to be used as the core of the E-Book.

### [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com) 
To create original images to contrast with the theme and the covered topics. 

### [chatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
ChatGPT was used as an instructor to provide hints, corrections and how-to content in order to create the document with the best practices possible (I'm not an expert in ANGULAR, so without chat-GPT it'll take much more time and effort to create this project and the E-BOOK)

## The other challenge was consisted of a Podcast creation using generative AI to create the script, the art and the voice to be used, allowing the creation of an entire episode in just a fraction of an hour, with all the post-effect processes it took no more than 2 hours to be done.  

### [chatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
ChatGPT was used as to create the script and also the image

### [elevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
To generate the podcast audio using the script generated by chatGPT (post effects added using capCut)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
